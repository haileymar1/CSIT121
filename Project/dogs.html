    <h2>Dogs</h2>
    <p>I have grown up with dogs my whole life. I currently have 4 dogs who are all American Bullies, i enjoy spending time with them. </p>
    <p>Whether we are going out to parks or swimmimg or just rides in the car, I'm my happiest with them. I've had them all since they were barely 6 weeks so I've raised them literally like my children lol. </p>
